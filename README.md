# ShineOn Theme App Extensions
> This repository helps you add ShineOn features to your theme product pages using Theme App Extensions.

## Getting Started

### Theme Files
Copy the files from the `templates` and `sections` folders to your theme's corresponding folders.
> _Don't worry if the theme already contains these files; they were included in the last theme upgrade (`v1.4.8`)._
